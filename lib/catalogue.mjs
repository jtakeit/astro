/**
 * jtk catalogue — write `jtk/catalogue.json`, and prove it matches the page.
 *
 * The admin edits a site by tapping the text on it, and it can do that for a
 * site built any way at all because it reads a catalogue rather than knowing
 * anything about the components. Which means the catalogue is the one file
 * standing between "a site that looks like nothing else" and "a site the owner
 * can edit" — and a catalogue kept by hand is a catalogue that drifts.
 *
 * So it is derived. `src/content/blocks.ts` is the declaration, in TypeScript,
 * beside the components; this emits it and then checks it against what the site
 * actually rendered:
 *
 *   every declared field  →  appears in the HTML carrying its data-jtk-path
 *   every annotated path  →  is declared here
 *
 * Both directions matter and they fail differently. A field declared and never
 * rendered is a control in the admin that edits nothing. A field rendered and
 * never declared is text the owner can see and cannot touch — and it is the
 * silent one, which is why `annotation-lint.mjs` exists at the other end of the
 * pipeline to catch it at build time too.
 *
 *   jtk catalogue                 # emit, then check against dist/
 *   jtk catalogue --emit-only     # emit, do not build or check
 *   jtk catalogue --dist ./dist   # check against a build made elsewhere
 *   jtk catalogue --judge         # and ask the real validator whether we agree
 *
 * Exit code is the number of disagreements. Zero means the admin can be handed
 * this repository.
 *
 * ── the checks below are a copy, and --judge is how it stays a good one ──────
 *
 * The authoritative catalogue validator is Go, in the admin's `registry`
 * package, reachable at `POST /v1/registry/validate`. The checks in this file
 * are a second implementation of the same contract, kept because this one has to
 * work offline, before a deploy and before there is a site to attach to — the
 * answer "that is not a usable catalogue" is worth having at the moment somebody
 * writes it, with a line number, rather than in the admin days later with none.
 *
 * Two hand-written validators of one contract disagree silently, so this one
 * sits the other's exam (wiki/35 §5): every finding carries the same `JTK_E_*`
 * code the server would give it, and `--judge` posts the emitted catalogue to
 * the real validator and reports every place the two answers differ. Every
 * client project the studio runs through it is one sitting.

 * `https://preview…/p/<slug>/`, where the root is not the site: every one of

 * checked here rather than written down anywhere: it has cost three separate
 * afternoons, and the third one was a site the kit had already been used to

 * `localhost:4321`, where the base is `/` and everything works.

 * from is the studio's arrangement — our preview, our prefix — and not something
 * the catalogue format says anything about; a stranger's repository could get
 * every one of these "wrong" and still be a repository the platform can build.
 * Giving them a `JTK_E_…` would put a name in the terminal that the platform's

// into a component, which carries no annotation, is in nobody's catalogue and is
// therefore invisible to both directions of the check.
//
// It is found by tapping, one string at a time, by whoever is looking at the
// site — "I cannot edit the header", "nor the footer", "nor the labels on the
// form", "nor the word above each section" — and every one of those is a
// message and a deploy.
//
// **This used to be a report and is now a gate.** A report made the decision
// optional, and optional is how twenty-six strings on a real site ended up
// belonging to nobody: the navigation, the footer and the labels on the form,
// with a note in the handover saying the line had been drawn deliberately. It
// had not been drawn at all — nothing was written down, so nothing could be
// changed, and the owner found out by wanting to change one.
//
// So every visible sentence must be one of two things, and both are a decision
// somebody made **in the repository**:
//
//   the owner's   →  declared in the catalogue and annotated: `data-jtk-path`
//                    (text on every page goes in the shared document — one
//                    copy, annotated everywhere it is drawn)
//   the design's  →  marked `data-jtk-fixed`, which says "these words are part
//                    of the composition and not the business's to change"
//
// `data-jtk-fixed` is what a skip link, a honeypot's label and a decorative
// caption carry. It silences a subtree, so one attribute on a wrapper covers a
// whole ornament. The edge takes it off the public copy the same way it takes
