/**
 * The names the platform gives to the things a catalogue can get wrong.
 *
 * ── this file is a copy, and that is not an accident ────────────────────────
 *
 * The set lives in the admin, in `backend/api/registry/errcode.go`, and that
 * table is the source of truth: it is what `POST /v1/registry/validate` answers
 * with, what the generated reference (`docs/reference/errors.md`) prints, and
 * what the troubleshooting page is tested against. Nothing here is authoritative
 * about anything.
 *
 * It is copied because `fl-catalogue` has to work before there is anything to
 * ask — on a laptop, before a deploy, before a token, on a plane. A local
 * checker that needs the network to name a fault is a local checker nobody runs.
 *
 * The alternative was generating this file from the Go table at build time, and
 * it was rejected for what it would cost rather than what it would buy: a
 * generator, a make target, a CI diff guard and a second repository in the
 * checkout, all so that a list of twenty-one strings can be regenerated on the
 * few days a year it changes.
 *
 * **What keeps it honest is `fl-catalogue --judge`, not anybody remembering.**
 * That flag posts the emitted catalogue to the real validator and reports every
 * place the two answers differ — a code the server raised and we did not, or one
 * we raised and it did not. Every client the studio runs through it is one
 * sitting of that exam (wiki/35 §5, §7), so a code that has been renamed or a
 * check that has drifted is found by the next real project rather than by a
 * reviewer noticing. A copy nobody checks rots in a month; a copy that is
 * examined weekly is a cache.
 *
 * Only the catalogue's codes are here. The build's five — `JTK_E_UNANNOTATED_
 * FIELD` and its siblings — belong to the annotation lint, which runs in the
 * platform's build container and is judged there.

 *
 * A code is a promise the platform's documentation keeps: every one of them has
 * a row in the generated reference and an anchor in the troubleshooting page,
 * enforced by a test over there. Inventing a `JTK_E_…` for a rule the platform
 * has never heard of would put a name in a developer's terminal that leads
 * nowhere when they go and look it up.
 *
 * And these are genuinely not the catalogue's business. Whether every address in
 * `src/` survives being served under `/p/<slug>/` is about the studio's preview
 * — our deployment, our arrangement, nothing to do with the format a stranger's
 * repository declares. The judge is right not to have an opinion on it.
 *
 * So they are marked, printed as plainly as anything else, and left out of the
 * comparison in `--judge`: their absence from the server's answer is the correct
 * answer rather than a gap.
