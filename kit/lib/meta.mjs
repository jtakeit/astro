/**
 * `_meta.json` — what the edge needs to know that the HTML cannot say — and
 * the specimen pages, whose addresses two things have to agree on.
 *
 * Cloudflare Pages read `_redirects` and `_headers` out of the build. The
 * platform serves sites from its own Worker instead, and this file is what
 * replaced them: one small object beside the pages, written by the build.
 *
 * ── drafts, and why the list has to exist ───────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An entry nobody has finished is **built** — that is how its author looks at
 * it before it is out — and it is in no listing, no feed and no sitemap. What
 * stops a stranger reading it is the edge, and the edge is serving static
 * objects: it has no way to tell a draft from a page except to be told. This
 * is being told.
 *
 * ── the specimens, which have no file at all ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The build also draws one page per arrangement, so that the panel can lift
 * this site's own markup for a block a post has just been given. They are
 * generated from the declaration rather than written, so looking for their
 * documents finds nothing — and a draft nobody can find is a draft the edge
 * hands to anybody. Listed here, derived the same way the site derives them.
 *
 * ── immutable, which directory is the build's own ───────────────────────────
 *
 * The files whose name carries a hash of their contents are cached by the
 * edge for a year and never revalidated, and under the preview's slug a
 * script's reference to one is put under the slug. Where they live is the
 * generator's to say: `/_astro/` for Astro, `/_next/static/` for a Next
 * export, `/_app/immutable/` for SvelteKit, `/assets/` for Vite. A build that
 * says nothing is taken to be Astro's. Never a directory with an unhashed
 * file in it — it would be stuck in browsers for a year.
