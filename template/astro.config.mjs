 * afternoons to see why.** A site's own address is a host — assets come out as
 * `/_astro/style.css` and resolve — but the studio's preview serves the same
 * build under `https://preview…/p/<slug>/`, where that path is not the site's
 * root and every stylesheet, every script and every image asks for something
 * that is not there. The page renders with no CSS at all, which reads as a
 * broken build rather than as a wrong prefix.
 *
 * Deriving it from SITE_URL is what makes it impossible to set one and forget
 * the other: they are one decision, and there is one place it is written.
 * A build for a real host gets `/` and nothing changes.
