/**
 * The grounds a page can be printed on.
 *
 * Data only — no DOM, no colour. `Pattern.astro` owns the layer, the ink and
 * every way it is allowed to fail; this file is what each ground actually looks
 * like, which is the part worth reading on its own.
 *
 * ── one idea holds the whole catalogue together ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * **A ground is a stencil, and the ink is a token.** Nothing here names a
 * colour. A stencil ground is an alpha mask over a layer painted in
 * `--pattern-ink`; a drawn ground is line art stroked in `currentColor`, which
 * is the same token. So a variant that changes its palette — or the studio
 * bar's live accent picker — repaints the ground with it, and a ground can
 * never arrive in somebody else's colour the way a shipped background image
 * would.
 *
 * The two mechanisms exist because they do different work:
 *
 *   STENCILS   a repeating figure with no beginning and no end. CSS only:
 *              a mask image, no markup, no bytes past this file.
 *   DRAWINGS   one composition that bleeds off its box. SVG, because a figure
 *              has a size and a place, and because strokes can draw themselves.
 *
 * Adding one is a row in either record. What it has to earn is a *different
 * job*: another spacing of parallel lines is `rules` with different constants,
 * not a seventh ground. Ask what a design could do with it that it could not do
 * with the six.
 *
 * ── what the geometry is measured in ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   --pattern-size     the figure's pitch: line spacing, tile, wavelength.
 *   --pattern-weight   stroke weight.
 *
 * Both are read straight out of CSS rather than passed through here, so a
 * variant can retune a ground per breakpoint — a 22px rule pitch that reads on
 * a laptop is a grey wash on a phone — without touching this file.
