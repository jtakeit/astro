/**
 * The ways a body of work can be shown.
 *
 * Data only — no DOM. `Gallery.astro` owns the markup, the motion and every
 * path back to a still page; this file is what each arrangement is *for*, which
 * is the part worth reading before choosing one.
 *
 * ── the choice is made by the material, not by taste ────────────────────────
 *
 * A tattooist with eight hundred posts and thirty-seven usable frames is not
 * the same problem as a baker with nine. The first needs volume to read as
 * volume; the second needs nine pictures each given room, because a wall of
 * nine looks like a business that has done nine jobs.
 *
 * So the first question is how much work there is, and the second is whether
 * the work has an order. Everything else follows.
 *
 * ── what an arrangement may not do ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Whatever it looks like, all six clear the same floor: no photograph is
 * stretched, nothing readable sits inside a moving surface, nothing scrolls the
 * page sideways, and `prefers-reduced-motion` gets the work laid out in full
 * and still — the finished thing, never a shorter one.
