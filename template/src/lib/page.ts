/**
 * Any page's content document, for a site that has more than one.
 *
 * ── what a second page costs, and why it is this file ───────────────────────
 *
 * The home page reads its own document through `src/copy/<locale>.ts`, which is
 * that page's *vocabulary*: `HOME.hero.title`, `HOME.cta.label`, shaped by hand
 * to the blocks this site happens to have. It is rewritten per project, which
 * is exactly why the generic reader is not in it — an agent reshaping the home
 * page's copy must not be able to break how every other page is read.
 *
 * So: a second page imports this, names its own path, and gets the same three
 * things the home page has — the blocks in order, a way to reach one, and the
 * annotation path for every field it renders.
 *
 *   ---

 *   const { at, of } = prices.block('rates');
 *   ---
 *   <h2 data-jtk-path={prices.pathAt(at, 'title')}>{prices.str(of, 'title')}</h2>
 *
 * ── the document has to be in the repository ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `jtk/content/prices.json` is committed with empty strings in it, the
 * same way `index.json` is, and for the same reason: a static import of a file
 * that is not there is a build error rather than an empty page, and a fresh
 * project has to build on a laptop before it has ever been attached.
 *
 * The admin learns the page exists when the branch is imported — a page is a
 * file somebody wrote, and that is the only way one comes into being.

 * obvious one: declared in each page's document, a three-page site has three
 * copies, and they diverge the first time somebody edits one. The owner changes
 * the footer on the prices page, looks at the home page, and reports that their
 * change disappeared. It did not — it was saved, on one page in three.
 *
 * So it lives in `jtk/shared.json`, once, and every field of it is
