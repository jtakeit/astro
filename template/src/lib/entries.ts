/**
 * Reading a collection: which entries there are, in the order the site lists
 * them, and without the ones nobody has finished.
 *
 * ── two rules live here and nowhere else ────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **A hidden entry is built and never listed.** It has to be built — that is
 * how its author looks at it before it is out — and it must appear in no
 * listing, no feed and no sitemap. The studio's edge serves such a page only to
 * a session that is editing the site; everybody else gets a 404. So every place
 * that enumerates entries goes through here, and the one that renders a single
 * entry does not.
 *
 * **The order is the collection's own.** `order.by` names a field of the entry
 * and the catalogue has already refused anything that cannot be sorted by —
 * a date or a number, and required. No declaration means the order somebody
 * arranged by hand, which for a set of works is the honest answer.

/**
 * What this file needs of an entry, written out rather than borrowed.
 *
 * The borrowed version was `CollectionEntry<string>`, and it was wrong in the
 * one case that matters most: a site with **no collections at all**. That is
 * not a broken state, it is the state every site is scaffolded in and the state
 * most of them stay in — a landing page has no blog. With `COLLECTIONS` empty,
 * `astro:content` generates the union of collection names as `never`,
 * `CollectionEntry<string>` collapses to `never` too, and every `entry.data`
 * and `entry.id` below stops type-checking against a type that has no
 * properties. Six errors, in the default project.
 *
 * Only `id` and `data` are ever read here, so those are what this says. The
 * cast at the call site is the price, and it is paid in one place.
