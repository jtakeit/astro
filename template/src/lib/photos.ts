 * photo with no alt text is a photo a screen reader announces as its file name,
 * and these sites are mostly photographs.
 *

 * variant's own tokens: no build step, no second copy of any file, nothing to
 * re-run when a photo is replaced, and it degrades to the untouched photograph
 * anywhere the blend modes do not land.
 *

 * because two is the look of a demo rather than a design, and **never a strong
 * one on their face**.
