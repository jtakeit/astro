/**
 * Reading a collection's entries out of the repository.
 *
 * ── why this is a loader of ours and not `glob` ─────────────────────────────
 *
 * An entry used to be markdown with frontmatter, and Astro's glob loader read
 * exactly that shape with nothing of ours in between. It could hold one block,
 * because the body *was* the file — and a post that wants a gallery between two
 * paragraphs cannot be written that way at all (the platform's wiki/30).
 *
 * So an entry is a document of blocks now, like every other page: a `.json`
 * file with `blocks`, the first of which is the post — its title, its date, its
 * cover and its prose. Everything after it is whatever the collection lets a
 * post hold, rendered by this site's own components.
 *
 * Which leaves one job glob cannot do: the prose is a *string* now, and it has
 * to become HTML through the same markdown pipeline as everything else.
 *
 * ── and not through `ctx.renderMarkdown`, which is the trap ────────────────
 *
 * That is the sanctioned call and it builds its renderer **without the plugins
 * this site configured** — Astro's own code, not a setting: it passes `image`,
 * `syntaxHighlight`, `shikiConfig`, `gfm` and `smartypants`, and stops. A body
 * rendered through it silently loses `figures.mjs`, so a row of three
 * photographs comes out as three paragraphs. Measured, not guessed at: the
 * markers Astro leaves for its image pipeline were still in the HTML.
 *
 * So the same renderer is built here with the same options, from
 * `markdown.mjs`, which is the one place either this or `astro.config.mjs`
 * reads. The `fileURL` is what makes `![](one.jpg)` resolve **beside the
 * entry's own file** — which is exactly where the build downloads it, so the
 * media pipeline is untouched by any of this — and `imagePaths` is what Astro
 * reads back to optimise them.

/**
 * One page per arrangement, built with everything else and listed nowhere.
 *
 * ── why a site builds a page nobody will read ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * The admin's preview is the built site with the draft patched onto it, and
 * that works while the shape is the shape the build knows. Put a gallery into a
 * post and it stops: the page has no element for it, and only a build can make
 * one — the arrangement is this repository's markup and this repository's CSS,
 * and an admin that drew its own would be guessing at both.
 *
 * So the build draws one of each, once. The admin takes the markup from here
 * and puts it where the new block goes, and what somebody sees is this site's
 * own arrangement rather than an approximation of it.
 *
 * ── rendered by the route that renders the real thing ───────────────────────
 *
 * Not by a page of its own. A fragment rendered somewhere else is styled
 * somewhere else — `:nth-child`, the classes of a parent, a grid that counts
 * its children — and the copy would be subtly wrong in a way nobody could see
 * until it was live. These are entries, so they go through `[...entry].astro`
 * inside the same article as every other post, and the context is identical by
 * construction.
 *
 * ── invisible, and that is not a trick ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `visible: false` is the same flag a post nobody has finished carries: every
 * place that *lists* entries skips it, the sitemap never sees it, and the
 * studio's edge serves it only to a session that is editing the site. Which is
 * exactly who asks for it.
 *
 * The pictures are the site's own, taken from the entries it already has. A
 * collection with no photographs anywhere gets an empty arrangement — the
 * container without its contents, which is still the right container.
