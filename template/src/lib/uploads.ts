 * The pictures the owner uploaded, as local files.
 *
 * ── the two places a picture can be ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `src/assets/hero.jpg` is the developer's: it is in the repository, it is
 * chosen by whoever built the site, and `photos.ts` resolves it by slot name.
 * This is the other half — a photograph somebody put in through the admin,
 * which arrives as a key like `media/<site>/<hash>.jpg` inside the content
 * document.
 *
 * **They are both local files by the time this runs.** The build's second step
 * downloads every key the content names into `src/assets/`, before `npm run
 * build`, precisely so that a photograph from the admin goes through
 * `astro:assets` exactly as one from the repository does: variants, `srcset`,
 * width hints, the lot. Nothing here fetches anything.
 *
 * That matters more than it sounds. A gallery of thirty-seven pictures served
 * as uploaded is fifteen megabytes; the same gallery through the image pipeline
 * is under two. The difference is not visible to anybody building the site — it
 * is visible to somebody on a phone, on a train, deciding whether to wait.
 *
 * ── on a laptop, before any of that ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There are no downloaded files while a developer is building the site, so
 * every lookup here answers undefined and `<Shot>` draws its labelled
 * placeholder. That is the same behaviour as a missing slot, and it is what lets
 * a site be built, checked and pushed before it has ever been attached.

 * Anything under `src/assets/media/` — which is only ever what the build put
