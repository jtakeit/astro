/**
 * What the admin may edit on this site.
 *
 * ── the one file that decides whether a bespoke site is editable ────────────
 *
 * The studio's admin edits a site by tapping the text on it. It can do that for
 * any site, however that site is built, because it reads a *catalogue* — this
 * file, emitted to `jtk/catalogue.json` — rather than knowing anything
 * about these components. That is the whole reason a site built here can look
 * like nothing else and still be handed to its owner.
 *
 * So the division is:
 *
 *   src/          the design. Yours, or the agent's. Anything at all.
 *   jtk/          the values. The owner's, edited in the admin.
 *   this file     which values there are, and what each one is
 *
 * **Declare a field here and the owner can edit it. Leave it out and it is part
 * of the design.** Both are legitimate — a headline is content, a section's
 * layout is not — and that decision is yours to make per field rather than
 * something a framework makes for you.
 *
 * `fl-catalogue` emits the JSON and then checks it against the built HTML: every
 * field declared here has to appear on the page carrying its `data-jtk-path`,
 * and every annotated path on the page has to be declared here. The two cannot
 * drift, which is what stops an owner tapping a heading that never opens.
 *
 * ── a label is the words ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The words themselves, in the site's language, and the admin shows them as
 * written. There are no locale keys anywhere any more — the admin's own blocks
 * carried them until 30 August 2026 and now do the same as this file, so our
 * blocks and yours are drawn by one code path.
 *
 * A site in more than one language writes the label per language instead:
 *
 *     label: 'Заголовок'
 *     label: { uk: 'Заголовок', en: 'Heading' }
 *
 * Which languages a site has is `LOCALE` and `LOCALES` at the foot of this
 * file; a label naming a language the site does not have is simply never shown.
 *
 * ── the labels below are English, and that is the scaffold speaking ─────────
 *
 * They arrive in English whatever `--locale` the site was scaffolded with,
 * because they are a **starting point rather than an answer**: the design pass
 * rewrites this file for the business it is building, and it writes the labels
 * in the language the owner will read them in.
 *
 * They used to arrive in Ukrainian, which was invisible while every site was
 * Ukrainian and wrong the first time one was not — a Swiss client opening the
 * panel found their blocks labelled in a language they do not read, and
 * nothing in the build said so. English is not a translation, it is an
 * admission that the scaffold does not know yet.
 *
 * The strings a visitor sees are the other way round: those are in
 * `src/copy/`, they are interface rather than seed, nothing rewrites them, and
 * `fl-init` fills them in per locale.

 *

 *   the admin creates the entries         and nothing else
 *
 * So there is no "blog feature" on the platform. A blog is one collection whose
 * prefix is `/blog` and whose entries are ordered by date; a portfolio, a price
 * list, a menu or a vacancy board are the same mechanism with different words,
 * and adding one is this array plus the two routes that render it.
 *
 * ── the two routes you owe a collection ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   src/pages/blog/index.astro      the listing — an ordinary page of yours
 *   src/pages/blog/[...slug].astro  one entry, from the content collection
 *
 * `fl-catalogue` checks the declaration; the build checks the rendering, the
 * same way it checks every other annotated field.
 *
 * ── the reserved keys ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An entry's block type may declare whatever this business needs, but five keys
 * are spoken for, because the listing, the feed, the sitemap, the card a
 * messenger draws and the admin's own list all read them by name:
 *
 *   title    text, and required. Everything above needs one.
 *   date     date. Required if the collection is ordered by it.
 *   excerpt  textarea. The sentence under the title in the listing.
 *   cover    media, one picture. The card, the listing, og:image.
 *   body     markdown. The entry itself.
 *
 * Leave any of them out where they make no sense — a set of works has no
 * excerpt. What you may not do is give one of those names to something else.
 *
 * An entry is stored as a page whose document opens with one block of the
 * declared type, so `blocks[0].body` is an ordinary annotation path and
 * everything else — versions, drafts, publishing, media — already applies.
 *
 * ── only when it was asked for ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **The scaffold declares none, and that is the right state for almost every
 * site.** Do not add one because a site could have one.
 *
 * A collection is a standing weekly obligation on the person who owns the site.
 * An empty blog on a live page says the business stopped caring in March, and
 * three posts from a year ago say it louder; a page that never mentions one
 * says nothing at all. The bar is a sentence in the brief that names the
 * thing — not a vertical it would suit, not room in the design, not «for
 * later». If the brief is silent, this array stays empty.
 *
 * A site that declares none shows no trace of them in the admin.

 * that. It had to be translated, by us, for every language anybody ever builds
 * in — and it went stale: the day the platform changes what it keeps or for how
