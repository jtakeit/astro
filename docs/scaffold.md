# The scaffold, and what the platform holds it to

```bash
npx @jtakeit/astro create <slug> --name "The Business" --locale de-CH --vertical salon
```

Copies `template/`, fills in the tokens, names the copy module for the locale,
writes a README and makes the first commit (`--no-git` to skip it). It decides
nothing about how the site looks: every component is a starting point, and the
contract below is the only thing the platform will hold the repository to.

## The tokens

| token | example |
| --- | --- |
| `{{SLUG}}` | `duckit` — the directory and the package name |
| `{{NAME}}` | `DUCK IT` |
| `{{LOCALE}}` | `de-CH` — the copy module's name, `src/copy/de-CH.ts` |
| `{{LANG}}` | `de-CH` — `<html lang>` |
| `{{OG_LOCALE}}` | `de_CH` |
| `{{PHONE_REGION}}` | `CH` — the region `libphonenumber` parses the number in |
| `{{SCHEMA_TYPE}}` | `LocalBusiness`, or `--schema-type HairSalon` |
| `{{PREVIEW_URL}}` | `http://localhost:4321/` — where `astro dev` says it is; every build the platform makes passes `SITE_URL` |
| `{{UI_*}}` | the form's and the privacy page's sentences in the site's language |

An unreplaced `{{` anywhere in the tree is a scaffold bug; the package's smoke
test fails on one.

## The `jtk/` contract

```
jtk/catalogue.json    what the owner may edit — derived from src/content/blocks.ts by `jtk catalogue`
jtk/content/*.json    the values, one document per page — the panel's, written by a publish
jtk/bookings.json     the diary's settings, when the catalogue turns bookings on — seed it here
jtk/design.json       the design document the panel reads for the editor's chrome
```

`jtk/bookings.json` has one shape, and it is the one a publish writes back: a
document of one block of type `bookings_config`, with the settings as that
block's fields. `jtk catalogue` writes the empty skeleton when the file is
missing; fill it in and commit it, and `import_branch` reads it into the diary
so the demo takes bookings before anybody opens the panel.

```json
{
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "bookings_config",
      "v": 1,
      "zone": "Europe/Zurich",
      "hours": [{ "day": "monday", "opens": 540, "closes": 1020 }],
      "horizon": 30,
      "confirm": "auto",
      "payment": "no"
    }
  ]
}
```

Times are whole minutes from midnight (540 is 09:00). The settings written as
top-level keys — no `blocks` — is the mistake the platform now refuses on import
with `JTK_E_MODULE_FILE_INVALID`, rather than reading an empty diary out of it.
The platform's modules reference lists every field.

The repository decides what a site *is*; the panel fills in the values. A commit
under `jtk/` **is** the published state, and a publish writes these files back.
`import_branch` reads them into the panel after you commit; `publish` makes them
what the preview offers.

## The build contract

The platform builds every commit in a container: `npm ci`, `npm run build`, the
annotation lint over `dist/`, upload. Three flags arrive as environment, read as
`import.meta.env`:

| flag | what |
| --- | --- |
| `SITE_URL` | the site's address, `https://<host>/` — the canonical and the sitemap follow it; under the preview it carries a path, `/p/<slug>/`, and `astro.config.mjs` derives `base` from it |
| `PUBLIC_INDEXABLE` | `true` once the site is launched; feeds the robots meta tag, `robots.txt` and the sitemap |
| `PUBLIC_JTK_ANNOTATE` | whether `data-jtk-path` is emitted — always on; the edge strips it for visitors |

`jtakeit-meta.mjs` writes `dist/_meta.json` beside the pages: the redirects and
the unfinished entries, which the edge cannot read off a page.

**The lockfile is pinned and committed.** `npm ci`, never `npm install`, in a
site: the platform's runner bakes the scaffold's `node_modules` so a build takes
twenty seconds rather than ninety, and a lockfile that drifted from the
scaffold's is a build that installs from scratch.

**There is no deploy.** The platform builds and serves; a site has no
`wrangler`, no Pages Functions, no server code of its own. The form posts to
`/api/lead` and the diary to `/api/availability`, `/api/book` and the rest, all
of which the platform answers beside the site ([lead-form.md](lead-form.md),
[booking.md](booking.md)).

## Astro only

Today Astro is the only generator the platform supports: collecting a
collection's entries reads their frontmatter with the site's own Astro,
pictures go through `astro:assets`, the flags are read as `import.meta.env`,
and the runner's baked `node_modules` are this scaffold's. A repository on
another generator does not build on the platform.
